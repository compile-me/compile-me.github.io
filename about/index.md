## About this Site and Theme

This is my personal website and blog where I put down my thoughts, solutions to problems and learning notes.

This is a static site hosted at [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and render from markdown to html by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). The design was forked from [JekyllMetro](https://github.com/olakara/JekyllMetro) by [olakara](https://github.com/olakara). I have made some modifications on this theme, and all files are under the [MIT License](LICENSE) as the original project.
